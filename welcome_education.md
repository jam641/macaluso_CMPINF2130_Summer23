# Welcome to the Education App!

This app allows a user to explore the `education` data set that was retrieved from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/students-exam-scores?resource=download).

This data set looks at some demographic and personal information (categorical variables) as well as performance on math, reading, and writing tests (continuous variables).

This app will be exploring the counts of all of the categorical variables as well as the distributions of all of the continuous variables.

This app will also allow the user to select different and multiple categorical grouping variables (i.e., via faceting and mapping onto color) to visualize the data.

Overall, the user can explore dynamic bar charts, dynamic distributions, dynamic scatter plots, and figures looking at correlations and PCA.
